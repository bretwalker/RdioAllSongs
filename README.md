RdioAllSongs
=============

This is a simple Python app to create playlists on [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com) for [All Songs Considered](http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/) shows.

This app is meant to run daily and it will do two things:
  * Create new playlists for new episodes
  * Update existing playlists, adding songs that weren't previously available (a common scenario with new music)
  
This app is probably of little use to anyone, but if you'd like to subscribe to these playlists, they are available here: http://www.rdio.com/people/AllSongsPlaylists/playlists/
